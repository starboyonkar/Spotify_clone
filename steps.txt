________________________________________
🔁 1. Clone & Branch
1.1 Clone your repository:
Replace the link with your actual repo URL:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spotify_clone.git

cd Spotify_clone
1.2 Create and switch to a new branch named feature-1

git checkout -b feature-1
1.3 Push feature-1 branch to GitHub:
git push -u origin feature-1
🟢 Now you’ve cloned the repo and created a new branch called feature-1.

🛠️ 2. Commit & Push
2.1 Make a change:
For example, open README.md and add a line like:

## 🎧 Feature-1: Added project enhancement
2.2 Stage and commit your change:
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added enhancement title in README.md"
2.3 Push your change to GitHub:
git push

🔄 3. Merge Branches
You have two ways to merge: via GitHub Pull Request (GUI) or Git CLI. Here's both:
________________________________________
✅ B. Via Git Commands
Switch to main branch
git checkout main
Pull latest:
git pull origin main
Merge feature-1:
git merge feature-1
Push merged main to GitHub:
git push origin main

✅ Optional: Clean Up
After merging, you can delete the feature branch locally and remotely:

git branch -d feature-1             # delete locally
git push origin --delete feature-1  # delete remotely
